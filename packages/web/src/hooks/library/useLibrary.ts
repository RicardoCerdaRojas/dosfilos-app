 *
 * `staleTime: Infinity` because the sync hook is the source of truth —
 * we never want React Query to fire its own background refetches that
 * would just stomp the snapshot the listener already pushed. The
 * `queryFn` is a fallback for the case where the sync hook hasn't
 * mounted yet (e.g. an early consumer renders before the dashboard
 * shell), so a one-shot fetch fills the gap until the listener
 * catches up.
 *
 * Use this in any consumer that just needs the resources list — paper
 * setup modal, faculty source picker, planner wizard, etc. The richer
 * `useLibraryResources` hook (LibraryManager page) layers index-status
 * tracking + counts on top and stays separate.
