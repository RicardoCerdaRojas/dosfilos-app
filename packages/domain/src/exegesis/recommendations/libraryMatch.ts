/**
 * v1.7.1 — Heuristic matcher for "is this curated recommendation
 * already in the user's library?"
 *
 * Two consumers:
 *   - The recommendation card UI: shows a green "En tu biblioteca"
 *     badge + open-in-library action when the user already owns
 *     the work, replacing the "Ya la tengo" personal flag.
 *   - Future: the corpus picker can pre-select matched works.
 *
 * Match is deliberately CONSERVATIVE — false positives confuse the
 * user ("why is the system saying I have this?"), false negatives
 * just leave the "Ya la tengo" affordance visible (no harm). Three
 * priorities:
 *
 *   1. **ISBN exact** — when both have it (rare on user side, but
 *      gold standard).
 *   2. **Series acronym** — "BDAG", "HALOT", "WBC 47A". Distinctive
 *      enough that a substring match in the user's title is high
 *      signal.
 *   3. **Author + title token overlap** — last fallback, requires
 *      strong overlap (≥70%) of significant tokens.
 *
 * Implementations of `LibraryResourceLike` only need the fields the
 * matcher reads — keeps this helper independent of the domain
 * `LibraryResource` entity definition (which lives in a different
 * module and pulls in extraction status, etc. that we don't need).
