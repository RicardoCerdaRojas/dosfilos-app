/**
 * Strips supporting quotes that are not present in the source text the
 * analyzer was given — and keeps the attribution.
 *
 * What changed and why: this began by deleting the whole attribution.
 * Over a real paper that turned out to destroy far more true work than
 * false: every drop it produced was a quote the model had transcribed
 * faithfully and this matcher failed to recognise — a PDF hyphenating
 * across a line, our own page labels sitting between two fragments, a
 * sentence spanning the seam where two retrieved fragments meet. Not
 * one fabrication.
 *
 * The danger was never the attribution. It was a fabricated sentence
 * presented as the author's own words. Removing the quote removes that
 * danger; removing the position also removes the student's engagement
 * with a source that did contribute text, which is theirs and which
 * nothing else can reconstruct. So an unverifiable quote is dropped,
 * the position stays, and the caller is told which — visible, and
 * reversible by a human.
 *
 * Matching is sentence by sentence. A quote reaches us as continuous
 * prose, but the source arrives as separately retrieved fragments, so a
 * true quote can straddle a seam that exists only in our packaging. Per
 * sentence, each side of the seam is checked against the material it
 * really came from. A fabricated sentence still matches nothing.
 *
 * Quotes carrying no text are left alone, as are sources whose text was
 * not handed to this check: refusing to judge beats judging blind.

 * What must survive is the sequence of letters, because that is what
 * separates a real quote from a reworded one.
 *
 * Whitespace and hyphens go entirely. A PDF breaks words across lines
 * — "comple-\ntamente", "pala-\nbra" — and a model reading that
 * quotes the whole word back. Keeping the hyphen made those quotes
 * fail and deleted true citations from a theological dictionary: a
 * worse failure than the one this file exists to prevent, because it
 * destroys the student's own sourced work and says nothing.
