/**
 * Per-step source-emphasis plan — the "how should the orchestrator
 * use my corpus for this specific step" decision.
 *
 * Why this entity exists: the user explicitly raised concern that
 * leaving the orchestrator to silently decide which sources to lean
 * on per step deprives the student of a learning moment. The plan
 * makes that decision visible and editable BEFORE generation runs:
 *
 *   - The student sees, per step, which source TYPES will be
 *     emphasized and which specific SOURCES are pinned to the step.
 *   - For novices, the plan is pre-filled from the rubric's
 *     `structuralExpectations` with a justification ("for verse-level
 *     analysis the rubric prioritizes lexicons + technical
 *     commentaries because…").
 *   - For experts, the same defaults appear and a single "accept all
 *     suggestions" button collapses the step to a confirmation.
 *
 * The plan is mutable until the step transitions to 'generating'.
 * Once generation runs against a plan, that plan version is
 * snapshotted onto the resulting `ExegeticalStepVersion` so we can
 * later answer "what plan produced this output?".
 *
 * Storage: lives on `ExegeticalPaper.stepPlan` as a single object
 * keyed by `stepId`. One plan entry per step. Plans for kinds the
 * orchestrator doesn't drive (`assembly`) are intentionally absent.
