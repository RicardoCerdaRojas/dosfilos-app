/**
 * Port the setup UI uses to turn a raw rubric document (PDF, EPUB,
 * pasted text) into a structured `PaperRubric`.
 *
 * Implementations live in infrastructure (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.). The
 * extractor receives ALREADY-EXTRACTED text — the file → text step is
 * the existing LlamaParse pipeline that produces the corpusId. Keeping
 * this port pure-text means the extractor doesn't need to know about
 * file storage, MIME types, or chunking.
 *
 * The implementation is responsible for:
 *   - Parsing the text into the `PaperRubric` structured form,
 *     mapping the rubric's vocabulary onto our `SourceType` catalog
 *     (the rubric likely says "comentario crítico técnico" — the
 *     extractor maps that to `commentary-critical`).
 *   - Producing localized `justification` strings in the requested
 *     `language`.
 *   - Filling in conservative defaults for fields the rubric doesn't
 *     mention (e.g. if the rubric is silent on `expectedLength`,
 *     return null rather than guessing).
 *   - Setting `provenance` to `'extracted-from-document'` or
 *     `'extracted-from-text'` based on `input.source`.
 *
 * Failures: throw — let the use case decide whether to fall back to
 * the default rubric or surface the error to the user.
